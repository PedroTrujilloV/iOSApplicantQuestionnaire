## Hi!
This is an iOS Questionnaire for iOS devs applicants App. The view is written in **Swift** with **Combine framework + UIKit**. As design patter I picked **MVVM** using **FRP**. This App persists the information using **CoreData**, allowing the user load any unfinished form in its latests state. This App uses as Backend service **Fire Base** to save copy of the data. The Application validates when any skill with more than 50 units is added. The application UI layout is universal, responsive and handle traits for any iPad or iPhone size.
